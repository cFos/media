Key features
------------


### Important connections first

cFosSpeed will ensure that most important programs and protocols will always receive higher priority over background-running connections, like torrent or updates downloads.

### Play online without lags

### Prioritize everything

You can configure the priority of individual programs or adjust the priority of network protocols, so all programs using it automatically will have the right priority. This means downloads, which have lower priority, don't cause lags while gaming or viewing videos, which have high priority, for example.
